Data in: use only members in target file

Model DIY = Zero

Predict Zeros in Y3 with zero models trained on Y1 and Y2

Determine the zero threshold with EDA

# Because of the zero inflated nature of the data and the evaluation
#  metric's bias for short stays, the training data uses only
#  members with short, non-zero days_in_hospital.

# Predict year 3 using models from both years . Each prediction is written into its own new column

# Copy predictions to new columns (for later comparison) and apply zeros predictions (overwriting the previous predictions where zero confidence exceeds a threshold)

Write these last two columns to file

Execute a python script that averages the two files
(OPTIONAL: use the optimized constant as a third val for average)

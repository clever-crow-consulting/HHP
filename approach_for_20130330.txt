1. Use ctree to find 0s and 15s
ctreemodel <- ctree(is.zero ~ n_claims+Sex+AgeAtFirstClaim+sum_pay_delay+CharlsonSum, data=y1df)
plot(ctreemodel)

2. Build Y1 and Y2 model with non-0 non-15 data.

3. Predict Y1 with Y2 & reverse. Assess Results.

4. Predict y3 with Y1 and Y3 data
classify 0s and 15s and overwrite predictions
average the 2 predictions
